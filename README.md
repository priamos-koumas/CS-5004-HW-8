Homework 8 

From Homework 7 to Homework 8, our UML class diagram has dramatically evolved to something more
layered. While Homework 7 focused on a more general "brainstorming" of the assessment and played a
critical role in how the team was going to design the game through Java/programming, Homework 8
dives into a program that is more detailed and specific, showing a clearer vision of relationships
between classes, interfaces, etc, and how they align with their given packages. The UML now shows a
color-coded design, telling the user what each package an entity belongs to, yet the most
significant difference is the addition of the game package, and how it is designed for the program
understand the JSON files and translate what is requested into a story-driven game. Each
aspect and attribute of the given JSON files, such as AvatarData, ItemData, FixtureData, etc. are 
being taken into consideration when developing their designated classes and how they will 
communicate with the rest of the UML was mainly developed during the completion of homework 7. 
Obviously throughout the In the development process from homework 7 to 8, there have been some 
methods added to the variety of classes, along with extra attributes, but the main takeaway is how 
the group was able to evolve our original UML, taking into consideration the basics and intertwining 
these concepts with JSON files to maximize the development process.
